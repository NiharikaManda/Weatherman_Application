## Design to Track User SignUp
1. We are using traditional javascript to track input on a form and send a request to server with entered information to save it in a database. If they leave the page without signup we can send an email to again consider signup.
2. Additionally We Can also, Use google analytics to track user clicking on the form. 


## Design consideration to make more people Signup
1. We need to show what are the Benfits user gain by signing up to the service.
2. To make people sign up animation make an important role.
3. Sending reminder emails to the user to finish signup which they left incomplete.
